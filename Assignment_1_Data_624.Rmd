Time series of class tsibble.

Details
This data is for operational demand, which is the demand met by local scheduled generating units, semi-scheduled generating units, and non-scheduled intermittent generating units of aggregate capacity larger than 30 MWh, and by generation imports to the region. The operational demand excludes the demand met by non-scheduled non-intermittent generating units, non-scheduled intermittent generating units of aggregate capacity smaller than 30 MWh, exempt generation (e.g. rooftop solar, gas tri-generation, very small wind farms, etc), and demand of local scheduled loads. It also excludes some very large industrial users (such as mines or smelters).
